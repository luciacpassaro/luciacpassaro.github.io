I am a researcher in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. I have previously served as Assistant Professor at the University of Pisa and I actively contribute to the international NLP and AI research communities.

My research spans both foundational and applied NLP, with a focus on information extraction, domain adaptation, and the trustworthiness of AI systems. My current work concentrates on neural language models for fact-checking and fake news detection, multimodality, and information extraction. Over the years, I have explored a wide range of topics, including affective computing and NLP applications in specialized domains such as legal, medical, and Public Administration contexts.

I regularly present my work at international academic and industrial conferences and participate in national and international research projects. My recent research interests increasingly address trustworthy AI and human–machine cooperation.

At the University of Pisa, I am *Expert on the subject* (*Cultore della Materia*) for the course of Computational Linguistics. I am a member of the [Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning Group](https://ciml.di.unipi.it), the [Pervasive AI Lab](http://pai.di.unipi.it/), and the [Computational Linguistics Laboratory](https://colinglab.fileli.unipi.it).


### Educational background
I graduated at the University of Pisa, where I got my bachelor in Informatica Umanistica (2009) with a thesis about automatic classification of event names in Italian and my master degree (2012) in Business Informatics with a thesis focused on the Business Intelligence process.

Before starting my doctoral studies in Ingegneria dell'Informazione, I spent two years working in a private company in the field of Business Intelligence.
I got my PhD in 2017 with a dissertation entitled “Distributional Models of Emotions for Sentiment Analysis and Social Media”.
