I am a researcher in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. I have previously served as Assistant Professor at the University of Pisa and I actively contribute to the international NLP and AI research communities.

My research spans both foundational and **applied NLP**, with a focus on **Information Extraction, Domain Adaptation, and the Trustworthiness of AI systems**. 

I regularly present my work at international academic and industrial conferences and participate in national and international research projects. My recent research interests increasingly address **Trustworthy AI** and **Human–machine cooperation**.

I am a member of the [Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning Group](https://ciml.di.unipi.it), the [Pervasive AI Lab](http://pai.di.unipi.it/), and the [Computational Linguistics Laboratory](https://colinglab.fileli.unipi.it).


### Educational background
I graduated at the University of Pisa, where I got my bachelor in Informatica Umanistica (2009) with a thesis about automatic classification of event names in Italian and my master degree (2012) in Business Informatics with a thesis focused on the Business Intelligence process.

Before starting my doctoral studies in Ingegneria dell'Informazione, I spent two years working in a private company in the field of Business Intelligence.
I got my PhD in 2017 with a dissertation entitled “Distributional Models of Emotions for Sentiment Analysis and Social Media”.
